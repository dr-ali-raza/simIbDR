# simIbDR
This code is developed in the AI & Robotics Lab of UET Lahore, Pakistan. One can access the lab-page at http://uet.edu.pk/pp/mct/~aliraza/lab.html 

This repository is the implementation of our methodology labeled as: Immunity-based Dynamic Reconfiguration of Mobile Robots in Unstructured Environments. The code is written in Matlab and allows the robots to autonomously choose the appropriate configuration of sensors, navigation modules, actuator settings and control options, using primarily the clonal selection theory. 
One needs to extract the files from the zipped folder and run simIbDR file within Matlab. The results folder may need to be defined prior to storing the results of simulation.
The code is shared as is with E&OE.
